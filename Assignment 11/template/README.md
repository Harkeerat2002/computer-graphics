## Problems Faced
We had problems understanding the excercise itself. We could not find a lot of materials from the slides to refer to and it was difficult to understand what was wanted. We feel like it was not properly explain and we had to make a lot intuations as to what is wanted. Also we did not knew how the final result looked like which made it diffcult to judge as to what is expected. We are quite happy with what we have achieved considering the lack of material and instruction, and at the end we implemented everything except the minor issue with the bottom right corner of the cloth.
