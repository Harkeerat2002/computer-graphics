# Problems:
We were able to do the first 2 Excercises properly, however, the third one we are facing some errors due to which we are not able to complete it. This is why there are 2 assignments file. The normal one is functional in which the solution can be seen, however, the one with the name "assignment_full_not_working" is the one with the implementation of excercise 3 as well.
